# Protocols

* [ocaml-zmq](https://github.com/issuu/ocaml-zmq)  – ZeroMQ bindings for OCaml.
* [async-zmq](https://github.com/rgrinberg/async-zmq)  – Async wrapper around ocaml-zmq.
* [lwt-zmq](https://github.com/hcarty/lwt-zmq)  – Lwt-friendly interface to ZeroMQ for OCaml.
* [onanomsg](https://github.com/rgrinberg/onanomsg)  – nanomsg bindings for OCaml.
* [Kafka](https://github.com/didier-wenzek/ocaml-kafka)  – OCaml bindings for Apache Kafka.
* [AMQP](https://github.com/andersfugmann/amqp-client)  – AMQP client library for Async and Lwt.
* [MPI](https://github.com/xavierleroy/ocamlmpi)  – Message Passing Interface bindings for OCaml.
* [MQTT](https://github.com/j0sh/ocaml-mqtt)  – OCaml implementation of the MQTT pubsub protocol.

# Security and Cryptography

* [ocaml-tls](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls)  – TLS in pure OCaml.
* [Digestif](https://github.com/mirage/digestif)  - Hash algorithms (like SHA* or BLAKE2*) in OCaml and C.
* [cryptokit](https://github.com/xavierleroy/cryptokit)  – The Cryptokit library for OCaml provides a variety of cryptographic primitives that can be used to implement cryptographic protocols in security-sensitive applications.
* [nocrypto](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-nocrypto)  – A small cryptographic library behind the ocaml-tls project. It is built to be straightforward to use, adhere to functional programming principles and able to run in a Xen-based unikernel.
  * The differences between `nocrypto` and `cryptokit` cryptographic libraries are described in [this blog post](https://mirage.io/blog/introducing-nocrypto)
